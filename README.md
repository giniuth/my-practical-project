# **EventsApplication**
# CRUD PROJECT
http://eventswebapp.azurewebsites.net/

The application I have been creating performs the actions of the requirements, Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD). As a small introduction to my application, users will be able to first specify the type of event they would like to host alongside their budget and additionally display an image so the decoration company can help tailor to their requests. Users will then be required to fill in additonal information including the option to have catering provided and a space for them to give us a detailed description into the services they require.

**Summary of app:**
---

<!-- UL -->
* Create an EvenType (Occasion Name) (E.g. Birthday, Wedding, Anniversary, Gender Reveal)

* Users will then set a budget (compulsory)

* Users can attach an inspo picture regarding the theme/design they want

* Users will then tell us what size cake they’d like

**Additional information:**
---

<!-- UL -->
* Users are then required to give us more details including the guest capacity, whether they’d like Alcohol, Catering and if so what Cuisine.

* Users at this point can add a description or give us further details that will help the event company when it comes to planning their specific event.

**Project Tracking**

[This is the link to my Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ioxDkTOo/qaproject)

Using a Trello board helped me visualise the process clearly and keep track of workflow against the time limit.The benefits of having a visual grid helped me see how much progress I was making. I also kept a column for hurdles/errors I overcame since I do believe its important to note down this information. Additionally, using a colour coding system helped me immensely (eg: Red was associated with urgent/I need help).

* Notes
* User stories
* To do
* Doing
* Done

In hindsight, I'm glad I took a simple approach - I was able to assign the tasks into the right column quicker and having less clutter on the Trello Board made it slightly less overwhelming.

**Testing**
---

*Mock testing (MOQ Framework)*
 
Moq is a mocking framework for C# .NET. It is used in **unit testing** to isolate a class under test from its dependencies and ensure that the proper methods on the dependent objects are being called. Mock objects allow you to mimic the behaviour of classes and interfaces, letting you code the in the test interact with them as if they were real.

In my code, I created a separate folder, repositories and interfaces and created objects that would mock my previous work. I then carried out tests (using test explorer) to see if my code was doing what it was supposed to. I tested all the features I had created, so add, delete, update. As you can see below 7 tests passed yet my coverage report shows a 37.5% line coverage. Red means these lines could run but are never executed.

*Reasonings:*
* The fact that the update button no longer works means the update section on the code coverage tests were not executed.
* Additionally, the add function of décor details I did inside the eventtypes controller, therefore the way I performed the test had to be different to how I did the tests for eventtypes tests because I now need to pass in the eventtype controller variable
* Another reason I have a lower test coverage is because I am testing files that should be ignored. I am testing for example the dbContext which could be ignored and as a whole this could be reducing my overall coverage percentage.

The routing constraint"{id:int}" tells the page to accept requests to the page that contain int route data. If a request to the page doesn't contain route data that can be converted to an int , the runtime returns an HTTP 404 (not found) error.

**Deployment**
---
I deployed my Web Application through Azure manually (using publish profile through azure app service) after facing many difficulties with the CI/CD approach. Azure's App Service hosts web applications, REST APIs and mobile back ends. These applications can be made in many languages, are scalable and run with ease. They support both Windows and Linux environments. It allows you to deploy any of your apps, in the way you prefer to do so.

Known issues:
---
* Users are unable to edit currently at this point in time
* Users can currently add more than one decor detail therefore I would need to change the code to make it that only one event has one corresponding decordetail

**Future improvements:**
---

* I would like to add the '£' sign when adding the budget, even though this company is UK based - it would make the website more credible
* Users might want to add more than one inspo picture, therefore a strategy for this could be implemented
* For the future, contact details and a log in system would be necessary
* There could also be more pictures uploaded from previous events that would help attract more customers and it would be a place for us to showcase our previous work
